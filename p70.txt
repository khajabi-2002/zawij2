p70.///The Fibonacci Sequence is computed based on the following formula:
 f(n)=0 if n=0
f(n)=1 if n=1
f(n)=f(n-1)+f(n-2) if n>1
Please write a program to compute the value of f(n) with a given n input by 
console.
Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:
7
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to 
be a console input.///

code:

n = int(input("Enter a positive integer n: "))


def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib = [0, 1]
        for i in range(2, n):
            fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])
        return fib


result = fibonacci(n)


print(result)
