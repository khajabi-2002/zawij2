p72.///Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be 
divisible by 5 and 7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is 
input by console.
Example: If the following n is given as input to the program:
100
Then, the output of the program should be:
0,35,70
In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to 
be a console input.///

code:

n = int(input("Enter a positive integer n: "))


def divisible_by_5_and_7(n):
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i % 5 == 0 and i % 7 == 0:
            yield i


result = ",".join(str(x) for x in divisible_by_5_and_7(n))


print(result)
